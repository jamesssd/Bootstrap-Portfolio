Description:
This homework was an exercise in using Bootstrap to try to recreate our Basic Portfolios as close as possible. 

Technologies used: 
-JPG
-Bootstrap
-Lorem (for paragraphs) and Lorem Pictures (for pictures)

Roadmap:
I intend to use this Bootstrap Portfolio for future use. Hopefully, the next time I use this, I have the tools I need to add JavaScript to make my Portfolio more appealing.

Shoutout/s:
-Thank you Trae for helping me with my footer! That took forever to do.

-And of course, Thank you Google for helping me with pretty everything!
